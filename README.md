# Python-ATM-Management-Project
The Tkinter-based ATM project simulates an Automated Teller Machine system, providing functionality for users to perform basic banking operations.

Using the Application

1.Starting the Application :

- The program starts with a graphical user interface (GUI) powered by Tkinter, presenting the user with an interactive screen.
- Users are prompted to enter their credentials (e.g., account number and PIN).

2.Account Management :

- Login: Users must log in using valid credentials. Once authenticated, they can access various banking options.
- Saved Accounts: The application uses pre-stored account data (in the program or an external file/database) to validate user inputs and manage accounts.

3.Core Banking Functions:

- Check Balance: Users can view their current account balance.
- Withdraw Money: Users can withdraw a specific amount of money, with the system verifying that the account has sufficient funds before completing the transaction.
- Deposit Money: Users can add funds to their account, and the balance is updated in real-time.
- Transfer Money: If implemented, this function allows users to transfer money to another account in the system.

4.Graphical Interface:

- The GUI is simple and user-friendly, with buttons for each operation (e.g., Check Balance, Withdraw, Deposit).
- Clear error messages and notifications guide users through the process, such as informing them of insufficient funds or successful transactions.

5.Exit and Security:

- Users can log out securely, ensuring their account information is protected.

6.Accounts in the System
- Accounts are typically stored in a Python dictionary or a file.
- Each account includes details such as:
   1- Account Number: A unique identifier for the user.
   2- PIN: Used for authentication.
   3- Balance: The current amount of money in the account.
   4- Transaction History: (Optional) A record of past transactions.

This project demonstrates basic banking operations and introduces key programming concepts like event-driven programming, file handling (if used for saving account data), and GUI development with Tkinter.
